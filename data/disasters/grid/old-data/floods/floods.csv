Output may have dropped 20 percent to about 1.4 million metric tons last month from November, Ng said, citing an estimate from Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Douglas Uggah Embas.Palm oil rallied this week to the highest level in almost two months on concern the wetter-than-usual weather that stretched from southern Thailand, through Malaysia and into Indonesia may hurt supplies. The floods displaced hundreds of thousands, damaged infrastructure and prompted the government in Malaysia to prioritize flood-mitigation works. The country is the world’s largest palm oil producer after Indonesia"" December 30, 2014: ""(MENAFN - QNA) Floods have hit several South-East and East Asian countries, with deaths reported Tuesday in the Philippines and Malaysia.At least eight people were killed and more than 30,000 displaced in landslides and floods triggered by tropical storm Jangmi in the Philippines, officials said, according to the (dpa) news agency.A family of five in Leyte province, 585 kilometres south-east of Manila, died when a landslide buried their house, local officials said.&nbsp;In the southern region of Mindanao, three people died from drowning, a bus accident and after being hit by a falling tree, police said.&nbsp;A boat carrying six people, including a town police chief, was missing off Southern Leyte province, the coast guard said.Jangmi, which first reached the Philippines Sunday, was moving west at 11 kilometres per hour and was expected to bring more rains over the central provinces for the rest of the week, the weather bureau said.&nbsp;
In Malaysia, a pregnant woman and her 1-year-old child were killed in a landslide early Tuesday in the central area of the Cameron Highlands, bringing the toll to 10, news reports said.&nbsp;Around 200,000 have been evacuated since flooding started in the country around December 20, with the eastern and central areas worst affected.&nbsp;Disaster relief was slowed by the ""complete collapse"" of the operations as rescue workers became victims of the flooding, said Mohamed Thajudeen Abdul Wahab, secretary of the National Security Council secretary, The Star daily reported.&nbsp;Malaysia's flooding had a knock-on effect when some residents of Kelantan state crossed into neighbouring Thailand for supplies, the Bangkok Post reported.&nbsp;Officials in Thailand's southern district of Su-ngai Kolok said the town has received many Malaysians looking for items such as candles and instant noodles.&nbsp;Thailand's three southernmost provinces are also experiencing heavy floods.&nbsp;At least 14 people have died and eight more injured according to officials from the Department of disaster Prevention and Mitigation.&nbsp;The floods have so far affected 1,415 villages causing the closure of 237 schools, 32 religious sites and 17 government offices in Thailand.&nbsp;Officials have issued severe weather warnings for the area with heavy rain expected for the next week.&nbsp;In Indonesia, waters were receding in West Java's provincial capital Bandung after 11 days of flooding that displaced nearly 15,000, said Marlan, the head of the district's disaster management agency.&nbsp;In Aceh, where more than 120,000 people were forced from their homes this month, cleanup operations were under way as floods subsided, the state Antara news agency said.December 27, 2014: ""(CNN) -- Even by Malaysian standards, this flooding is epic.Neighborhoods turned into islands surrounded by a sea of murky brown water. Streets doubled as rivers. Cars were swept away and toppled over.The flooding has forced more than 132,000 people to evacuate, Malaysia's official Bernama news agency said.Strong currents and interrupted power supply are adding to the chaos, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak told reporters.""Clean water supply too cannot be delivered, and flood victims at the temporary relief centers had to endure darkness without electric supply,"" he said, according to Bernama.The flooding ravaging Malaysia started more than a week ago. While the region is accustomed to monsoons, the ""northeast monsoon"" that has gripped Malaysia, Indonesia and southern Thailand is particularly harsh.Here's how it works, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said Saturday:Strong high pressure develops over Eastern Europe and China and strengthens northeasterly winds from the South China Sea, bringing heavier rainfall over Malaysia, Indonesia and southern Thailand.And it's going to get worse. Another 100 millimeters (4 inches) of rain could fall over the next two days near the Malaysia-Thailand border, he said.""That leaves open all kinds of possibilities -- more flooding, and the possibility of landslides and mudslides,"" Van Dam said.
Across the Bay of Bengal, Sri Lanka has been hit hard, too.Kandy, in the center of the island nation, received more than twice the average monthly rainfall in just the past eight days, Van Dam said.December 21, 2014: ""Kuala Lumpur (dpa) - Floods worsened in north-east Malaysia Sunday due to heavy rains, local authorities said, as evacuees in other areas began to return home amid improving weather.The number of people who were evacuated in the state of Kelantan rose to 21,868 from more than 15,000 on Saturday, the chief minister’s office said.

Zuma Press
BEIJING—Flooding in southwestern China over the past week has left 44 people dead and 18 missing, and caused damage to housing and crops, the Civil Affairs Ministry said Saturday.

Constant heavy rain since Aug. 31 has caused widespread destruction in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, as well as the megacity of Chongqing, where all but one of the deaths occurred and all of the missing were reported.

The ministry said 121,700 people had been moved to temporary shelters and put the number of collapsed or heavily damaged houses at 42,000. It estimated total damage at more than 3.3 billion yuan ($538 million).

Southwestern China's mountainous terrain increases the chances of landslides brought on by the loosening of rain-saturated hillsides.

Seasonal rains cause major flooding around China most years. The worst in recent history was in 1998, when more than 4,000 people died, most of them along the Yangtze River.

The massive Three Gorges Dam has largely contained Yangtze flooding, but the problem persists in other parts of the country apart from the arid northwest.",

A regional meteorologist quoted by the Andina state news agency says nearly five inches of rain fell on Arequipa during a seven-hour period that began Friday afternoon.Police officer Cesar Villegas told The Associated Press by phone Saturday that homes were destroyed and cars flipped over by surging floodwaters in the city of 800,000 residents. Video broadcast on Peruvian television showed muddy torrents tearing apart dirt streets.Regional Gov. Miguel Guzman said in a TV interview that at least two bridges have collapsed and several outlying towns are cut off.TORRENTIAL rain has been creating havoc along the Pacific coast side of South America, with flooding causing the deaths of at least six people in Peru.In the southern city of Arequipa, thousands of people were left without electricity and drinking water.In Bolivia, nearly 9,000 families across the country were affected by flooding, said the authorities.A downpour in the Andean region of Chile has also led to fresh water shortages in the capital, Santiago.Authorities say four million people were affected by the cuts to freshwater supplies caused by landslides near San Jose de Maipo.They reportedly contaminated two rivers that supply the city's water plants.Aguas Andinas water company said it would start restoring the supply on Saturday night and expected to bring it back to normal by Sunday afternoon.Last week, even Chile's Atacama desert, one of the driest places in the world, suffered with heavy rain. Three weeks ago, another contamination of the river Maipo left at least two thirds of the 5 million residents of the capital without water.In Peru, authorities have declared a state of emergency in Arequipa.The national meteorological service said that the bad weather brought down the equivalent of three months of rain in about seven hours.""It's a record of records. There are no records of an event of this magnitude"", the local director of the service, Sebastian Zuniga, told the Andina news agency.At least two bodies were found in a car that submerged in the mud after a road collapsed.More than 48,000 people are said to have been affected by the rain.Torrential rain has also fallen over most regions in neighbouring Bolivia.Nearly 9,000 people are said to have been affected and crops lost to the rain.

Last week, Brazil announced it would send 500 tonnes of rice to aid Bolivians hit by the natural disaster."

Amancio Nhantumbo of the Mozambique National Disaster Management Institute (INGC) said the flood-related deaths occurred in the province of Nampula and were caused mainly by “drowning, acute diarrhoea and lightning”.Nearly 2 000 homes have been destroyed in the area, INGC said, with thousands of displaced families living in resettlement camps.Nampula authorities were carrying out compulsory evacuations of residents living in low-lying areas at risk of further flooding.In southern Mozambique, floods have killed 105 people and displaced 150 000 since the beginning of the rainy season in October.Meanwhile, Cahora Bassa hydroelectric CEO Antonio Muxanga told reporters that transmission lines carrying electricity to South Africa were under threat and could collapse at any time.The United Nations emergency humanitarian fund today announced it will distribute more than $5 million to provide life-saving assistance to hundreds of thousands of people who have been affected by the recent floods in Mozambique.Heavy rains last month led to massive flooding in the southern part of the country, killing 105 people and displacing some 150,000. Hundreds of houses were destroyed and crops and infrastructure severely damaged.In a news release, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the Government and its partners have already allocated $10 million to cope with the emergency. However, given the scale of the disaster, more resources are required for those who lost everything in the floods.The funds, $5.13 million in total, will be distributed from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), which is managed by OCHA, to various UN agencies to provide basic needs and services such as shelter, food, medical aid, water, sanitation and hygiene, and logistical protection to those in need.“While much has been done, much more is needed. These CERF funds will go a long way in ensuring that assistance is provided to those who need it most,” said the UN Resident Coordinator in Mozambique, Jennifer Topping.
The World Food Programme (WFP) will receive $2.3 million, and more than $1 million will be allocated to the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), respectively. A further $820,000 will be given to a joint UNICEF/UN Population Fund (UNFPA)/World Health Organization (WHO) project"" January 31, 2013: Maputo, Mozambique - The United Nations says the death toll from the flooding in Mozambique has risen by seven to at least 55 people.The U.N. said Thursday that heavy rains in northern and central Mozambique have displaced 19 000 more people, raising the total number of displaced by floods the past two weeks to nearly 170 000.
The Mozambican government said there is a shortage of food for flood victims in southern Mozambique. Luis Nhala, a health official, said that residents are eating food that has mixed with contaminated flood water, which is resulting in cases of diarrhoea and vomiting.""January 15, 2013:""MAPUTO, Jan 22 – Mozambique authorities on Tuesday considered the evacuation of 50,000 people after heavy rainfall in the flood-struck south, where hundreds died in a major deluge over a decade ago, an UN aid agency said.
The waters have killed 35 people since the start of the rainy season last October — 13 in January alone — and eight major rivers are above alert levels.

“The alert level is five metres (16 feet). Yesterday it reached six (metres). If it will go one more metre then it will create a big problem,” said Hanoch Barlevi, local emergency specialist at the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).
“If this scenario happens, the community that is going to be affected is around 50,000 people,” he told AFP.
The southern Africa nation is experiencing the heaviest rainfall since devastating floods in 2000 killed around 800 people and affected millions.
According to Barlevi, authorities have since developed sophisticated disaster management systems, so a repeat of the tragedy is unlikely.
From Sunday to Monday almost 185 millimetres (over seven inches) of rain poured over the Limpopo river basin in southern province Gaza, where the most vulnerable communities live.
Rains in neighbouring countries also swelled rivers, and authorities opened the sluices from two dams in the south to lower dangerous levels.
Coastal Mozambique is home to nine international river basins, making it especially vulnerable to flooding. Although the rainfall has stopped in most areas, the risk of flooding remains high as waters arrive from further inland.
“Unfortunately there are always consequences from the entire region and not only in Mozambique. The rain stops but the effects come a few days later,” Barlevi explained.
Mozambique’s disaster management teams are set to meet later Tuesday to decide on evacuations.   Beitbridge Bureau — ZIMBABWE and South African border authorities were yesterday forced to stop both vehicular and human traffic after the bridge at the Beitbridge Border Post was flooded on Sunday night.

The border was only open to travellers after 3am when the waters subsided.

The torrential rains also claimed the lives of three children aged between four and nine years when the houses they were sleeping in collapsed.

Authorities at the border post were forced to stop traffic after the flooded Limpopo River left the New Limpopo Bridge inaccessible.

The bridge links Zimbabwe and South Africa.

The bridge was temporarily closed for three hours at midnight on Sunday.

It was only reopened at around 3am when the water had subsided.

Border authorities from both countries had to harmonise traffic control systems to ensure the safety of motorists.

They also temporarily suspended movement of heavy vehicles over the bridge.

The Old Limpopo Bridge was safe for pedestrians though the situation was under close monitoring by the authorities.

The children's deaths bring to five the number of people who have died in Beitbridge District due to torrential rains that started last week.

Two people drowned, one along Bubi River and another one in a pond in the town.

Forty-two more people were stranded at Chituripasi Village 10, under Chief Elsh Matibe's area.

Their huts were destroyed by heavy rains that hit the area on Saturday and Sunday.

Authorities had also dispatched an Air Force of Zimbabwe helicopter to assist stranded villagers yesterday afternoon.

Beitbridge Civil Protection Unit chairman Mr Simon Muleya said the situation was terrible. Three children were killed in separate incidents when their homes collapsed during heavy rains in Limpopo over the weekend, authorities said.


Vhembe district municipality spokesperson Matodzi Mulaudzi said on Sunday the municipality's disaster management team received the reports about the deaths of two boys and a girl on Sunday morning. 

""A helicopter was sent to a house in Mutele D Village, where it was reported that a girl was killed after a house collapsed on her on Sunday morning,"" said Mulaudzi.

The helicopter was sent after the municipality's disaster management team was unable to gain access to the village in their vehicles because Mutele River was overflowing. Two other children were killed in two separate villages in Malamule.

Police spokesperson Colonel Ronel Otto confirmed the death of two boys who were killed when their homes collapsed in Malamulele on Saturday night and Sunday morning.

Mpumalanga police spokesperson Colonel Leonard Hlathi said three people were killed when lightning struck their houses in Piet Retief during heavy thunderstorms on Saturday morning.

Also in Mpumalanga, an eight-year-old boy was believed to have been swept away in Tonga by the streams and a 67-year-old woman killed after her mud-constructed house fell on her.

'Hardest hit'
""The Tonga area near Komatipoort has been hardest hit by the bad weather in the province with three vehicles having been reported as being swept away by the Nkomazi River,"" said Hlathi. 

These included a traffic department vehicle, with an unconfirmed number of occupants, an ambulance with two paramedics inside, and a private car with two occupants inside. Hlathi said the paramedics were rescued by members of the police water wing.

""Two occupants in the private vehicle were rescued by members of the South African National Defence Force,"" he said.

Other survivors were rescued after they managed to hold on to the trees on the side of the roads until help was found.

KwaZulu-Natal provincial spokesperson Lennox Mabaso said some roads had to be closed on Saturday after heavy rains blocked several drainage systems in the northern parts of the province.

""A disaster management team was mobilised and sent to eMpangeni to clear several roads where the water drainage systems were blocked,"" said Mabaso. He said a disaster management team had since been activated and was monitoring the situation.

Assessing the damages
On Friday, 31 houses were flooded at Kanana in the North West, officials said on Sunday. Provincial spokesperson Lesiba Kgwele said a disaster management team was assessing the damages. 

""No other serious crisis were reported including at our borders where we were expecting an influx of visitors from Botswana for the Cup of African,"" said Kgwele."

Superstorm Sandy threatens 'catastrophe' of a lifetime
Tropical Storm Son-Tinh was moving northeast along the northern Vietnamese coast on Monday after tearing the roofs off hundreds of houses and breaching flood defenses overnight, the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported.
Son-Tinh was at typhoon level when it thumped into northern Vietnam late Sunday with winds as strong as 133 kilometers per hour (83 mph). It left three people dead and two injured, according to an initial estimate from the Office of the National Search and Rescue Committee reported by (VNA).
More than a 1,300 rescue workers and soldiers have been deployed to work with local authorities on search and rescue efforts in the aftermath of the storm, VNA said.
Helicopters were on standby for a search and rescue mission for an oil rig with 35 people on board that became disconnected from its towboats miles out at sea amid strong waves generated by the storm, according to VNA.
And five people were missing Sunday after winds from Son-Tinh sank an engineering vessel near a cargo terminal in Sanya, a city on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported.
Son-Tinh is expected to gradually weaken over the course of Monday, regional weather agencies said. At least 260,000 people in Vietnam had been relocated to safer areas as it approached Sunday.
The storm had already killed 27 people when it swept across the central Philippines during the second half of last week, causing flash floods and landslides, according to the Philippine National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Nine people remain missing, the council said Monday.
East Asia is buffeted for several months a year by heavy storms that roll in from the western Pacific Ocean. In August, a big typhoon, named Bolaven, killed more than 60 people on the Korean peninsula.",

About 200 miles south, in Cooper Landing on the Kenai Peninsula, the Kenai River had yet to crest and the National Weather Service extended a flood warning until Monday afternoon saying that the river will continue rising. Residents of one subdivision were told to be ready to evacuate.
Forecasters said rain would continue falling Sunday, making it tough to predict how high waterways would rise on the peninsula and when they'll crest.
The outlook seemed a bit better in Talkeetna. Rivers and streams draining from the Talkeetna Mountains had crested and water levels fell steadily Friday night, the weather service said. Meteorologists said they don't expect rainfall to significantly increase river levels there, but a flood warning remained in effect for the area as many waterways remained above flood stage.
The Talkeetna River crested at 15.65 feet on Friday, just below the level considered major flooding. It had receded to 12.5 feet by Saturday afternoon, just above the 12-foot flood mark. Only two streets in Talkeetna remained flooded, the Anchorage Daily News reported (http://bit.ly/UDvlWG).
Talkeetna is the last stop for climbers heading to Mount McKinley, North America's tallest mountain. It also has an eclectic population, and has long been purported to be the inspiration for the Alaska town in the TV series, ""Northern Exposure.""
Longtime residents told the Daily News that flooding was the worst they'd seen in more than 30 years. Still, emergency responders said it could've been worse.
""Luckily, we didn't have any buildings float away,"" said Mike Krepel, who runs the Talkeetna Historical Society Museum with his wife, Jenny.
Krepel used a large pump to drain the museum's flooded first floor.
""It blew its way in pretty quick,"" Krepel said. ""We don't think we lost anything important, but we were going pretty hard for several hours.""
Flooding has caused problems over a wide swath of Alaska this week, from Talkeetna to the port town of Seward, 175 miles to the south.
Department of Transportation crews have been working to protect several bridges on the Glenn Highway from fast-moving water. The road is one of two land routes out of populated areas in Anchorage and Wasilla, and the only one in southern Alaska.
The Alaska Railroad was closed through Wednesday as crews repair tracks and bridges, including a 500-foot stretch that was left dangling when the ground beneath it washed out about 35 miles north of Talkeetna.
The American Red Cross of Alaska has opened three shelters in recent days, and a fourth was opened Saturday at the state fairgrounds in Palmer, about 40 miles northeast of Anchorage, where evacuees could park recreational vehicles.
Gov. Sean Parnell declared a state disaster Friday for communities hard-hit by recent storms. The declaration covers the Kenai Peninsula Borough, which includes Seward, and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, which includes Talkeetna, Wasilla and several other towns, the governor's office said.
It was too soon to estimate damage and no injuries have been reported.
""We're just waiting for the next storm to come in, and then we'll start the rodeo all over again,"" said Vickilee Fenster, a spokeswoman for the Mat-Su Borough's Emergency Operations Center""",
